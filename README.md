# Design-and-Implementation-of-Secondary-Storage-System

Design and Implementation of Seconday Storage System
Each program has three files server.c, client.c and makefile. The makefile will compile and make executables of both server.c as server and client.c as client.
Server for program 1 and 2 can be excuted as: ./server
Server for programs 3, 4 and 5 can be excuted as ./server numberofcylinder numberofsectors filename
Client for all programs can be excuted as ./client
Server must be executed before the Client. So, that there is no connection failure on Client Side.
